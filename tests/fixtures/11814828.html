<span class="c00">Artory | Berlin, Germany | Full Time | ONSITE<p>(Senior) Developer<p>We are looking for developers interested in fine and contemporary arts (our focus is not in the buying/selling portion of the market process). We have a small team of designers and developers, and would like to add more developers to further drive our development efforts. We are putting a lot of user research into our product, in the hope of allowing developers to guess less about what our users want.  Decisions around the stack are still in the making and you can be part of these discussions, too. Development efforts organized with scrum, so you should be comfortable with that.<p>Current interview process:<p>* Short programming test, shouldn't take long and you'll receive a reviewed version back, regardless of our decision to take hiring further
* short call on getting to know each other, figure out open questions from CV etc
* 1h skype call/coffee/onsite casual/technical conversation, we'll send you a rough set of topics beforehand when we're interested in specific knowledge/topics
* potentially another conversation on team fit
* 1-2 compensated work day(s)<p>Our stack: python (django), postgres, elastic, angular2, typescript, docker + (what you might add)<p>Some benefits: Market pay rates for Berlin, Apple-y hardware to work, awesome office, (maybe) stock options.
Specializations/topics we are interested in (non-exhaustive) and if you like any of these, please get in contact:<p>* Full stack security
* Data deduplication/cleanup
* OCR text recognition and extraction
* Blockchain-related technologies
* Infrastructure automation<p>If you are interested in other topics which you think might be relevant to startups in the art world, please don't hesitate to still inquire.<p>If you are interested to hear more, get in touch through sebastian.hillig -- @ -- artory.com.

<span class="c00">Artory | Berlin, Germany | Full Time | ONSITE<p>(Senior) Developer<p>We are looking for developers interested in fine and contemporary arts (our focus is not in the buying/selling portion of the market process).

We are putting a lot of user research into our product, in the hope of allowing developers to guess less about what our users want.  Decisions around the stack are still in the making and you can be part of these discussions, too. Development efforts organized with scrum, so you should be comfortable with that.<p>Current interview process:<p>* Short programming test, shouldn't take long and you'll receive a reviewed version back, regardless of our decision to take hiring further
* short call on getting to know each other, figure out open questions from CV etc
* 1h skype call/coffee/onsite casual/technical conversation, we'll send you a rough set of topics beforehand when we're interested in specific knowledge/topics
* potentially another conversation on team fit
* 1-2 compensated work day(s)<p>Our stack: python (django), postgres, elastic, angular2, typescript, docker + (what you might add)<p>Some benefits: Market pay rates for Berlin, Apple-y hardware to work, awesome office, (maybe) stock options.

We are putting a lot of user research into our product, in the hope of allowing developers to guess less about what our users want.  Decisions around the stack are still in the making and you can be part of these discussions, too. Development efforts organized with scrum, so you should be comfortable with that.<p>Current interview process:<p>* Short programming test, shouldn't take long and you'll receive a reviewed version back, regardless of our decision to take hiring further
* short call on getting to know each other, figure out open questions from CV etc
* 1h skype call/coffee/onsite casual/technical conversation, we'll send you a rough set of topics beforehand when we're interested in specific knowledge/topics
* potentially another conversation on team fit
* 1-2 compensated work day(s)<p>Our stack: python (django), postgres, elastic, angular2, typescript, docker + (what you might add)<p>Some benefits: Market pay rates for Berlin, Apple-y hardware to work, awesome office, (maybe) stock options.
Specializations/topics we are interested in (non-exhaustive) and if you like any of these, please get in contact:<p>* Full stack security
* Data deduplication/cleanup
* OCR text recognition and extraction

Insikt (pronounced “in-seekt”) is a white label loan origination and investing platform that enables any brand to lend to its customers and any accredited investor to invest in consumer loan portfolios. Insikt was born out of our realization that banks will not be the lenders of tomorrow – brands will. Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation.

Insikt (pronounced “in-seekt”) is a white label loan origination and investing platform that enables any brand to lend to its customers and any accredited investor to invest in consumer loan portfolios. Insikt was born out of our realization that banks will not be the lenders of tomorrow – brands will. Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan.

Insikt (pronounced “in-seekt”) is a white label loan origination and investing platform that enables any brand to lend to its customers and any accredited investor to invest in consumer loan portfolios. Insikt was born out of our realization that banks will not be the lenders of tomorrow – brands will. Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending.

Insikt (pronounced “in-seekt”) is a white label loan origination and investing platform that enables any brand to lend to its customers and any accredited investor to invest in consumer loan portfolios. Insikt was born out of our realization that banks will not be the lenders of tomorrow – brands will. Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation.

<span class="c00">Khan Academy | Mountain View, CA or REMOTE | full-time and internships<p>We're bringing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.<p>Over the past 10 years we've gone from Sal's family project to a global institution reaching 100+ million students annually. And the testimonials we receive every day remind us that our impact isn't just about big numbers — access to free education meaningfully changes the lives of people in all sorts of situations. (In a recent survey, 64% of first generation students at selective colleges said that “Khan Academy has had a meaningful impact on their education”.)<p>We face intense challenges in providing access to students across the world (think: everything from videos to interactive content, in and out of classrooms, in all the most important languages, on all the most important devices). We use our data to personalize students' learning and continually improve our content. We're trying to build a strong, diverse team — and we need more help.<p>We've made some great hires off HN and would love to make more. Especially if you're a designer or experienced engineer. Best way to apply is at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers" rel="nofollow">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a>. Mention HN.<span>

<span class="c00">Khan Academy | Mountain View, CA or REMOTE | full-time and internships<p>We're bringing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.<p>Over the past 10 years we've gone from Sal's family project to a global institution reaching 100+ million students annually. And the testimonials we receive every day remind us that our impact isn't just about big numbers — access to free education meaningfully changes the lives of people in all sorts of situations. (In a recent survey, 64% of first generation students at selective colleges said that “Khan Academy has had a meaningful impact on their education”.)<p>We face intense challenges in providing access to students across the world (think: everything from videos to interactive content, in and out of classrooms, in all the most important languages, on all the most important devices). We use our data to personalize students' learning and continually improve our content. We're trying to build a strong, diverse team — and we need more help.<p>We've made some great hires off HN and would love to make more. Especially if you're a designer or experienced engineer.
